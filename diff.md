# Difference Equation vs. Differential Equation

## A new way to time evolve 

We've so far looked at the time evolution of a quantum state by separating out the function in terms of position and time, using a differential approach, where we
multiply the x positions of a wavevector (in position space) by the time-dependence: 

$$ \begin{equation}\label{tdse} \mathcal{H}\Psi(x,t) = E\Psi(x,t) \end{equation} $$ 

Where the time dependence is represented as: 
$${T_n(t) = e^(((âˆ’iEnt/hbar))}$$
