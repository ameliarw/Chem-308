## Born-Oppenheimer Approximation

The Born-Oppenheimer Approximation states that because the mass of a nucleus is so much larger than the mass of an electron, on the time-scale of the motion of an electron, the nucleus can be treated as stationary. In reality, the nucleus is not stationary, but on the electron time-scale, the electron state does not change appreciably with the changing position of the nucleus. 

While it has been established that the electron state depends parametrically on the location of the nucleus, the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation allows for a simplification of the Hamiltonian describing the energy of an electron and two nuclei. 

The Hamiltonian to describe the overall system consisting of two different nuclei and one electron, an H2+ system, can be broken down into two different functions - one that depends on the separation between the two nuclei, and one that depends on the distance of the electron from the nuclei. This electronic function will also depend parametrically on the nucleus-nucleus distance. 

The Hamiltonian to describe this system can be rewritten as a series of operators that describe the potential energy and kinetic energy of the nuclei and the electron: 


The Hamiltonian must describe both the translational motion of the electron and nuclei in the system as well as the potential interactions between them. 

The electronic function parametrically depends on the radius of the nuclei. 

The separation of variables allows for an approximation. 

By diving by psi * chi the functions which don't depend on r or R can then be canceled out and the expression can be simplified. The product rule can then be used to further simplify the expression of the kinetic energy of nuclei A and B by taking the second derivative of the functions. 

When everything is simplified down as much as possible, the end result is a total potential function which depends on both the repulsion of the two nuclei as well as the attraction between the nuclei and the electron. Gives rise to the shape of the potential energy function - 

In the graph above, the total energy of a system is depicted by changing the radius ()()()().
