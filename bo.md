## Born-Oppenheimer Approximation

The Born-Oppenheimer Approximation states that because the mass of a nucleus is so much larger than the mass of an electron, on the time-scale of the motion of an electron, the nucleus can be treated as stationary. In reality, the nucleus is not stationary, but on the electron time-scale, the electron state does not change appreciably with the changing position of the nucleus. 

While it has been established that the electron state depends parametrically on the location of the nucleus, the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation allows for a simplification of the Hamiltonian describing the energy of an electron and two nuclei. 

Because the
