Angular momentum, linear momentum, and energy must all be considered 

CONSERVATION
Energy must be conserved

Conservation is a construct - we want energy to be conserved because we say it is constant, not changing. 

Symmetry - rules shouldn’t change over time - time symmetry 
Time symmetry implies energy conservation. 
If the rotational symmetry is conserved, then angular momentum is also conserved. 
If the position symmetry - if the same thing can happen over a different space, linear momentum is conserved.  

SELECTION RULES
The mechanism which allows for the transition will define which transitions are allowed. 
We’ve been talking about electric dipole moments - where light is an oscillating electric field. 
The strongest interaction is between the electric dipole moment and light. 

What are dipoles? 

Permanent dipole moment 
This is not what we are about - we care about oscillating dipole moments 
What is the expression to describe the dipole 
Scales linearly with separation and charge 
Dipole = charge * displacement 
If we have more than one charge/dipole, we can sum them 

The oscillating dipole moment - is what we care about
How do we take the energy from the electromagnetic field to apply to some object - the oscillating dipole moment allows us to do this. 
Sine wave to model the propagation of the electromagnetic field. The amplitude is representative of the vectors which would represent what force a positive test charge would feel in the electromagnetic field. The sign indicates the direction and the length of the vector indicates the magnitude of the field. 
SO the dipole vibrates - stretches and compresses when the electromagnetic field interacts with it. 
What happens when you change the orientation such that the dipole is horizontal along the electric field. The electric field applies a torque, the dipole rotates as it encounters the electromagnetic field. 
RESONANCE - so which sorts of wavelengths, energy works 
When the incoming frequency of the oscillating field matches the frequency of the natural oscillation of the distant dipole absorbance increases. At the resonance frequency, the efficiency with which you can couple the energy 
Before the resonance frequency, out of phase, 0 degrees, then at the resonance frequency, 90 degrees, quadrature, then eventually after the resonance frequency, out of phase, 180 degrees. 
Quantum Systems
Let’s use particle in a box because it is familiar 
Keep a proton outside of the box so that we have a dipole 
Let’s put the electron in a stationary state, a familiar state. 
There is a dipole, a fixed (both the positive charge and the electron are time independent, so fixed), between the positive charge and the electron in the well - remember that the dipole moment only depends on distance 
Because we are describing probability values, we probably want to use the expectation value for position to describe the distance between the positive charge and electron 
When you have a linear combination of stationary states, you get an oscillating dipole moment because the expectation value of position is changing and thus the distance between the electron and the fixed charge is changing, is oscillating. 
Leap to atomic orbitals 
Can I go from a 1s to a 2px by absorbing a photon? 
In the 1s and 2px, we don’t have an oscillating dipole moment because we expect the dipole moment to be zero, we expect the electron, on average, to be found at the nucleus, so the dipole moment between the two would be zero, distance equals zero. 
Does the passing through state, the transition dipole moment, exist? 
So how can we describe the transition from 1s to 2px, with a transition dipole moment. 
So the transition really is a linear combination of 1s and 2px 
The probability of being in 1s vs being in 2px can vary over time, so we will have time varying coefficients to describe the contributions of 1s and 2p 
Think about what the 1s and 2p look like together with constructive and destructive interferences - more probability on the left side because constructive, less on the right, destructive
So we  now have a dipole moment 
The 1s and 2p are time evolving with changing phase 
The 2p is switching phase faster than the 1s is switching phase, giving us an oscillating dipole 
The difference between the frequency of the 1s and 2p, as given by the energy difference of the states, give rise to the oscillating of this transition 
Think about going from a 1s to a 2s and from a 1s to a 3d
