# Particle in a Box

The particle-in-a-box model builds from one dimensional motion to three dimensional motion, and restricts the movement of a particle by certain boundary conditions. This model is said to mimic the idealized movement of a gas-phase molecule that is free to move in a container. If there are no boundary conditions, the particle acts as a free particle and can exist anywhere. With the addition of boundary conditions, the function is only allowed to exist at certain positions - this is to say that we have quantized our particle’s movement. We model the particle’s movement with a function, called a wavefunction, and can use mathematical operations to describe many properties of the particle. The particle's motion can also be thought of being modeled by a wavevector, and thus the Particle in a Box model also lends itself to linear algebra applications as well. 


By placing the particle in a box surrounded by infinite potential, the particle essentially can only exist within the box, and therefore the motion is constrained. This simple model illustrates the foundation of quantum mechanics and quantization of energy. While theoretically, the particle's motion is constrained by impenetrable walls of potential energy, in reality, particles have the ability to tunnel through potentials which they would not classibly be able to penetrate. Quantum tunneling is the phenomenon of particles overcoming energy potentials that these particles do not classically have the capability to overcome. The energy that the particle needs to overcome the barrier is higher than the energy of the particle, therefore, following the classical laws of physics, the particle would not be able to change state. This tunneling phenonmenon can be observed in the figure below, where the probability amplitude of the particle is first plotted (a) and then the probablity density is displayed (b):

The second energy eigenfunction of the Particle in a Box model in the position basis can be thought of as a linear combination of different {x} positions to create an overall function. The {x_1} position has some contribution to the overall function, the {x_2} position has a different contribution to the overall function, and the {x_3} position has a different contribution to the overall function. This idea continues for all {x} positions and their contributions, and therefore an overall quantum state.
