Convey PE function, how it comes from Born-Oppenheimer, total energy of molecule is PE 
Move to the idea of a hypersurface 
Everything we are doing, we are constraining dimensions - everything is co-linear. Why does this correspond to products and reactants, vib vs. translational, LJ, LEPS.
Where does the shape of the potential come from. The saddle point in LEPS is two dimensions -
