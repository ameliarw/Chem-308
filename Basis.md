### Change of Basis

In order solve the time dependent Schrodigner equation, we will first use an "easy" basis, then change the basis such that the 
solution is in the basis we want. 

Take for example the Hamiltonian operator. 
To see how a quantum state evolves over time, we will perform the Hamiltonian operator and separate the variables. 

If and only if your quantum state is an eigenvector of the Schrodinger
