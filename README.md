# Chem-308
This course focuses on using linear algebra to describe the properties of quantum states. Relying on a foundation of quantum principles and linear algebra concepts, we can use matlab to model different quantum states to better understand their time evolution. This website serves as a repository of key quantum concepts as well as programs which allow us to see the time evolution of quantum states, both stationary and non-stationary in the position basis, the energy basis. Other programs serve to demonstrate the probability density of finding the particle at a specific position as well as calculate the expectation value for position and energy for a certain energy state.

((((and have been using a Gaussian curve to fit the probability density to a specific location in order to better understand the relationship between position and momentum.))))
