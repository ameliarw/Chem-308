# Chem-308
This course focuses on using linear algebra to describe the properties of quantum states. Relying on a foundation of quantum principles and linear algebra concepts, we can use matlab to model different quantum states to better understand their time evolution. So far, we've created programs to allow us to see the time evolution of quantum states, both stationary and non-stationary in the position basis, the energy basis, and we've plotted the probability density of finding the particle at a specific position. We've calculated the expectation value for position as well as energy and have been using a Gaussian curve to fit the probability density to a specific location in order to better understand the relationship between position and momentum.
