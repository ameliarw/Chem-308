## An Introduction to Perturbation Theory 
Perturbation theory is the idea that we can better understand the behavior of an unknown quantum state by first looking at a familiar, known model. 

We've begun with a small introduction to perturbation theory with the left well/right well example which we looked at in class on 2/28. 
To better understand the behavior of the particle in the well with a central barrier, we can combine the behavior of the particle in the left well and right well. 
We will essentially change basis from the left well and right well to the basis of the central barrier. This mechanism will be further explored in the Perturbation2018 code presented below.

The vectors from the left and right well are contributing differently to the depiction of the central barrier, as depicted in the graphical representation below.
