### Using the Gaussian Approximation
The ultimate goal of this modeling is to be able to say something about the localization of the particle in space. So far we have used eigenvectors to find the probability of finding a particle at a particular location over time, but we can also introduce a probability density with a Gaussian curve to better understand how position evolves with time.

##### The Fourier Transform
The Gaussian curve is a special case where there is minimum uncertainty in both position and momentum. This allows the curve to look similarly both in the position and the momentum space. The Forier transform translates a curve from one domain to its complimentary domain. In the case of the Gaussian curve in the position domain and its complimentary momentum domain, it appears with the same bell-shape curve in both domains. 

This makes the Gaussian a good model. While the Gaussian model has the smallest uncertainty in both position and momentum, there is still a relationship between the shapes of the curve in these two domains. We can use this understanding of uncertainty to think about how the probability density of the position domain relates to the probability density of the momentum domain for the same state. If the curve is narrow in the position domain, that is there is a larger probability of finding the particle at a certain position, the curve of the Gaussian in the momentum domain will be broader - this is to say there is a wider distribution of possible momenta, as there is more uncertainty in the momentum. If there is greater uncertainy in the momentum (if the curve is broad in the momentum space), the curve in the position space will in turn also broaden, as the momenta which are faster would contribute to the particle moving faster to a new location and the slower momenta would contribute to the particle moving slower to a new location, increasing uncertainty in the location of the particle and causing a broadening in the Gaussian.
