## Summary of Key Quantum Ideas
-----
A wavefunction provides the complete description of a quantum state. We will begin to use state vectors as the complete description of a quantum state in order to organize this information and manipulate it using linear algebra. In order to determine different qualities of a wavefunction, or state vector, an operation must be performed. Operating on wavefunction yields an observable, or a value specific to that quantum state. Different operators provide different information - there are operators for position, momentum, energy, etc. 


### How can the energy of a quantum state be determined?
The Hamiltonian operator is comprised of both the kinetic energy and potential energy operator. In simplified models, like the one-dimensional particle in a box model, the potential energy of the box is generally set to zero while there is infinite potential energy out of the box - this is to say that the particle exists in a well of infinite potential. 

[perhaps I could put a picture in here]

### The Hamiltonian operator operating on an eigenfunction will yield the energy of that quantum state multiplied by the original eigenfunction:

$$
\hat{H}\Psi = i \hbar\frac{\partial{\Psi}}{\partial t}
$$
 
This expression is also called the Schrodinger Equation.

- The solutions to the Schrodinger, or the set of eigenvalues can be represented by {En}. This set is the complete list of possible total energy measurement results. 

- If two operators do not commute, then they do not share the same set of eigenfunctions. This is also to say that they do not have the same basis.
